# petecb-keyboards

This repo contains my keyboards, it is meant to be added with the following command if your base qmk_firmware repo does not contain the submodule by default:

```
cd qmk_firmware

git submodule add https://github.com/PeterHindes/petecb-keyboards.git keyboards/petecb
```

For further information, each keyboard has its own README.
